## About

I found by chance this cool project from slavanap called **[Windows10ManualUpdate](https://github.com/slavanap/Windows10ManualUpdate)** a few weeks ago and decided to take a closer look at it. **It allows you to customize and download Windows 10 updates manually.** Finally I managed to have a first look at it today and created a 1:1 fork. 

This is my first attempt to rebuild the Windows Update GUI. It adds some touches of [zeealeid's concept](https://twitter.com/zeealeid/status/1220319947831812102). Its not finished yet and some elements were made unrecognizable with blur effects but the main functions of delivering and installing updates manually work of course.
 
You are welcome to take a closer look at it and support slavanaps project or this fork. I would be very sorry if the project goes under. It has definitely had to be better valued.

## How-to

**Before running this app you should turn off automatic updates installation (not a requirement)**. This could be done via Group Policy Object Editor MMC snap-in or via the Patchfluent UI by enabling the option **Automatic updates**
