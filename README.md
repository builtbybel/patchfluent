## About

I found by chance this cool project from [slavanap](https://github.com/slavanap) called **[Windows10ManualUpdate](https://github.com/slavanap/Windows10ManualUpdate)** a few weeks ago and decided to take a closer look at it. Finally i managed to have a first look at it today and created a 1:1 fork. First i took care of the name and named it **Patchlady**. As an alternative I had PatchPal in mind, but didn't want any trouble with Elon "PayPal" Musk ;).

You are welcome to take a closer look at it and support slavanaps project or this fork. I would be very sorry if the project goes under. It has definitely had to be better valued.
